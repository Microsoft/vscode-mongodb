> NOTE: This extension is DEPRECATED. Please use the [Cosmos DB extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-cosmosdb) which supports connecting to local and remote MongoDB databases.

The MongoDB extension makes it easy to work with MongoDB NoSQL databases, collections, and documents. With this extension, you can:

* Connect to local or hosted (e.g. Azure CosmosDB) servers
* Create and view MongoDB databases and collections with the MongoDB Explorer
* Author MongoDB "Scrapbooks" with rich IntelliSense (completions) for MongoDB scripts, including collections
* Execute scripts and see results directly in VS Code
* Update documents in place

# Prerequisites

- Install [Mongo DB and Mongo shell](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/).

# Features

## Mongo Explorer

- Add a server by clicking the `+` button in the title.
  - Typical connection string for a local MongoDB instance: `mongodb://localhost:27017`
- Expand the connected server to see the Databases
- Click on a collection to see the documents
- Remove a server by right clicking on the server name and selecting the `Remove Server` command

## Mongo "Scrapbooks"

- Configure the user setting `mongo.shell.path` to your mongo shell executable path
- Click on any DB to open the Mongo shell playground editor
- Enter your scripts, eg: `db.<collectionName>.find()`
- IntelliSense (completions) will be provided as you write your scripts
- Select the script and press `CMD+'` (`CTRL+'` on Windows and Linux) to see the results
- Edit your documents, right click, and choose the `Update` command to persist changes to the database
